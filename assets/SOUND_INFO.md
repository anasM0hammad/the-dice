# Dice Roll Sound

To add a dice rolling sound:

1. Find or create a dice roll sound effect (MP3 or WAV format)
   - You can download free sounds from websites like:
     - freesound.org
     - mixkit.co
     - zapsplat.com
   - Search for "dice roll sound effect"

2. Save the sound file as `dice-roll.mp3` in this `assets` folder

3. The app will automatically use this sound when rolling the dice

## Alternative: Use the Generated Sound

For now, the app uses a programmatically generated sound as a placeholder. Once you add your own `dice-roll.mp3` file, it will use that instead.
