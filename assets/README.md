# Assets Folder

This folder contains all static assets for the app like images, icons, and fonts.

## Required Assets

You'll need to add these files before building a production app:

- **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024px)
- **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- **splash.png** - Splash screen image (2048x2048px recommended)
- **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48px)

For now, the app will use Expo's default assets when you run it.

## Generating Assets

You can generate proper app icons and splash screens using:
- [Expo Assets Generator](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/app-icons/)
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD
- Icon generators online

## Note

When you run the app without these assets, Expo will use default placeholders, which is fine for development!
